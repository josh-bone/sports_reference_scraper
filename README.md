# sports_reference_scraper

## Background

This is _far_ from the first sports-reference scraper. However, on January 1, 2023, sports-reference.com retired their "widgets" feature, which formed the basis of many of existing scrapers. This repository does not use that functionality, so it is the most up-to-date scraper as of my knowledge (in March 2023).

I'm creating this repository _mostly_ to familiarize myself with PyPI packaging and best practices. Feel free to use it in your personal work, research, or passion projects!

### Last working TestPyPI installation:

```pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ sports-reference-scraper==0.1.1```
